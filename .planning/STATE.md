## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- None yet.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 (Layer System) is highest risk: stdscr-to-panels migration must be complete, no partial adoption. Mixing stdscr with panels causes visual corruption.
- INTERFACE library static globals: Layer manager global state needs extern declarations with single definition in one .c file. Needs validation during Phase 3.
